Our project is a mini bowling challenges game fully controlled by a mobile app and detecting hand movement. The game is basically built of three parts: <br>
1. A slide for the balls that moves side-ways and angularly and can throw the balls, and it will be controlled by hand movement and a button. <br>
2. XY robot with a base that arranges the pins according to a specific arrangement input and detects which pin has fallen in every round. <br>
3. A mobile app which controls a robot by sending the desired arrangement and receives the result and saves it. <br>
